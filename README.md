Description : I observed that the physical process of filling an application for a railway concession form and then waiting in long queues to collect it from your college office is a common problem for many students
across many colleges (including mine). Even though few colleges have online form filling softwares, but still many lack this convenience. Thus I have created this system for Railway Concession form filling 
process and Form Printing. This System is made using Java Classes & Servlet for backend and handling client requests,MySQL for DB, HTML,CSS and Javascript for frontend.
