RCform_prototype
<br>
Description : I observed that the physical process of filling an application for a railway concession form and then waiting in long queues to collect it from your college office is a common problem for many students
across many colleges (including mine). Even though few colleges have online form filling softwares, but still many lack this convenience. Thus I have created this prototype system for Railway Concession form filling 
process and Pass Generation, which will be upscaled into a multi-functional website later. This prototype is made only using Java language and it stores the form data in an excel file. There are 3 classes, one for 
handling & stroing(in excel file) form submissions and generating a unique 'Concession ID'(which will be submitted during form collection). One class which accepts the for the Concession ID, fetches the data from 
excel file and generates the pass. One last file for handling and performjing Update and Delete operations in the excel file.
